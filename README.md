# UCSD CSE152A Intro to Computer Vision

This repository contains a collection of assignments and projects I completed as part of my CSE152A course at UC San Diego(UCSD). Each project explores different aspects of computer vision, including image processing, photometric stereo, object detection, and deep learning.

## Project Descriptions

### [Project 0: Basic Image Processing Tasks](https://github.com/chojaework/CSE152A_Computer_Vision/blob/main/0.%20Intro%20to%20Computer%20Vision.ipynb)
This introductory assignment focused on getting started with Python and NumPy for basic image operations, including vectorization and manipulation of image channels.

### [Project 1: Photometric Stereo and Image Rendering](https://github.com/chojaework/CSE152A_Computer_Vision/blob/main/1.%20Photometric%20Stereo%20%26%20Image%20Rendering.ipynb)
This project involved implementing photometric stereo, image rendering, and working with homogeneous coordinates and camera matrices.

### [Project 2: Edge Detection and Image Matching](https://github.com/chojaework/CSE152A_Computer_Vision/blob/main/2.%20Edge%20Corner%20Detection%20and%20Theory.ipynb)
I implemented edge and corner detection, SSD and NCC image matching, and explored epipolar geometry in stereo vision. 

### [Project 3: Image Classification Using Bag-of-Words](https://github.com/chojaework/CSE152A_Computer_Vision/blob/main/3.%20Image%20Classification%20%26%20Bag%20of%20Words.ipynb)
This project focused on building a bag-of-words model for image classification, including interest point extraction, feature extraction, and using a K-nearest neighbor classifier. 

### [Project 4: Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://github.com/chojaework/CSE152A_Computer_Vision/blob/main/4.%20Deep%20Learning%20for%20Computer%20Vision.ipynb)
In this project, I worked on backpropagation, trained a small CNN for MNIST digit classification, and applied transfer learning techniques.
